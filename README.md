## Quiz Data Format

The quiz questions are stored in a JSON file in the following format:

[
  {
    "question": "Question 1",
    "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
    "correctAnswer": 2
  },
  {
    "question": "Question 2",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correctAnswer": 1
  }
]
```

Ensure that the JSON file follows this structure for the quiz player to load the questions correctly.
